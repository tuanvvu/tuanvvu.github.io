#### Teaching

My main research focuses on better understanding **air pollution**, 
from *emissions* through *atmospheric physico-chemical transformations* and *interactions between air pollution, climate change and the biosphere* to *exposure and effects on human health*. I have been recently worked on **domestic energy use** and the impacts of **Net Zero** pathways on
future air quality in the UK.

I am also interested in applied **machine learning** for air quality modelling and integrated assessment of the **emission-health-socioeconomics nexus** and air pollution **mitigation solutions & interventions**.
