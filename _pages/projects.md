My main research focuses on better understanding **air pollution**, 
from *emissions* through *atmospheric physico-chemical transformations* and *interactions between air pollution, climate and the biosphere* to *exposure and effects on human health*.

I am also interested in applied **machine learning and AI** for air quality modelling.
