In my early work, I have used a mass balance model to estimate outdoor-indoor air exchange and to 
investigate indoor dyanmics of air pollutants (i.e. penetration and infiltration factors, deposition/evaporation rates of aerosols).

I am now using the CONTAM/EnergyPlus model to study air flows and transportation of air pollutants inside buildings.
