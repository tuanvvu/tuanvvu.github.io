I have carried a lot of **sampling campaigns** to collect particles and then analysed their properties using a wide range of measurements techniques.

**Air Pollution Measurement Technique**: 
1) High time resolution particle sizer (FPMS, SMPS, APS, OPS, T-HDMA) 
2) Other high time resolution instruments (ACSM, Aethalometer, low-cost sensors)   
3) Air samplers (High vol., Digitel, partisol, casecade impactor)

**Lab experiment**: GCxGC-TOF-MS, GC/MS, OC/EC analyser, IC analyser, ICP-MS and XRF

I also developed **numerical modelling approach** to estimate physical properties of particles (i.e hygroscopicity and effective density).
